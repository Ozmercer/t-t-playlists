# TtPlaylist

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.1.

## Thoughts

I am happy to present this assignment in the brand new Angular 11!

The work was pretty straightforward - manipulating the data arriving from the given
endpoint, building a welcome screen, a category list (that filters the playlists by
category) and a detailed category view.
Since no design was supplied for a single category, I went on a small tangent to 
build a function that randomly generates a simple background texture.

The app is built using the Angular router and a lazy-loaded module, global type 
interfaces and tests.


The biggest challenge I had was to do with testing. I haven't had much experience 
testing on Angular, so I had to check how most of the tests I wanted to make should 
be built.

I hope you enjoy the app, and I look forward to hearing your insights.
